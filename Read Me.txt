As you know, No-JS fingerprint generator is developed without JS.
So it is using CSS.

@media (min-width: 2340px) and (max-width: 2341px) {
#width::after {
 background-image: url("server.php/?data=value")
}
}

As show above, if screen resolution value is between min-width and max-width,   'background-image: url("server.php/?data=value") }' of CSS attribute is runed.
So url value is sent to server.
As likewise, other CSS attribute is runed. 
Then  server side is recived data value.
Also request is included header value.
Therefore server side is recived header value.

Sum value = CSS + Header.

As last, this value is crypted with sha256.
And this result is sent to client and saved database.
